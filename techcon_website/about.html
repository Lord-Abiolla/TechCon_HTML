                TechCon began as a small regional meetup in 2014, organized by a passionate group of
                developers and tech entrepreneurs, with an aim to create space for tech talent to
                network, learn, and showcase innovation. Initially attended by just over 150 participants, the event
                grew in size and influence, moving to different cities each year and attracting wider
                participation from tech hubs across various continents. By 2020, TechCon had evolved into a full-scale
                conference, featuring workshops, product launches, and panel discussions with leading
                tech figures.
